By adjusting a set of weights and biases to fit itself to a dataset, neural networks are extremely versatile and can find patterns in many different types of data. Neural networks can also be built to specification, with different types networks and fine-tuning built for use cases such as image classification, time series analysis, and more.\n",

Activation function are generally one of the following for an ANN, and we choose based on which one we think could perform well on our dataset. A full list of common activation functions can be found [here](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/neural-networks-activation-functions) but for ANNs we usually pick one or more of these:\n",

For example, if we are solving a classification problem on a set of images, we may use ReLU for the hidden layers, then sigmoid for the output layer as the output *must* be between 0 and 1. We select activation functions as follows for our example (note: the selections for this example are arbitrary):\n",

        "- sample is inputted\n",
        "- sample is run through the layers (forward propagation) to produce a prediction\n",
        "- error against the output is calculated using the error function\n",
        "- weights and biases are updated in reverse order (back propagation). Note that this may not happen after every sample, as discussed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is repeated for all samples, completing what is known as an epoch. Once we have completed the desired number of epochs, training ends. To define a training sequence, we specify a few parameters:\n",

        "- number of epochs\n",
        "- batch size (number of samples after which we run a single back propagation)\n",

We can now begin the next step of forward propagation, which is hidden layer 1. Recall the formula for the forward propagation function for all neurons in layer 1: $f_{j} = \\sigma(\\overrightarrow{x} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{w_j} + b_j)$, $\\sigma(x) = max(x, 0)$. We now need to construct $\\overrightarrow{w_j}$. The shape of the list of weights in our neural network is (number of inputs, number of neurons). Thus, for the first neuron, its weights are the first item in each subarray. For layer 1, this is `[1.811, -0.409, -0.599]`."
